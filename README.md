Analysis stock of green energy companies

## Overview of Project

In this assignment, we are creating VBA script for Steve so he can analyze stock results to help his parents choose green energy companies for investing. The analysis will consider:  

- **Daily Volume**: the total number of shares traded throughout the day to measure how actvively a stock is traded. 

- **Yearly Return**: the percentage difference (increase or decrease) in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

The end product needs to give Steve the tools he needs to easily run the program on his own with results that are quickly and easily understood based on the year of his choosing. 


## Results
"Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
"The analysis is well described with screenshots and code. 

### The Data
2 seperate arrays (tickers symbols and ???)
Create buttons for end-user
Refactor (making code more efficient) to make the script run faster so Steve can perform the analsis on larger datasets in the future. 

### The Analysis
12 different stocks - 2 seperate years on the 
Final chart provides XXXXX with red and green formating 

### Refactoring


## Summary
"What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
"How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
"there must be a deteailed statementent of the advantages and disadvantages or refactoring code in general
"There is a detaile d statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

Could use different shades of green to better differntiate the levels or degrees of positve performance.
