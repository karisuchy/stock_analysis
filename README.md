Analysis stock of green energy companies

## Overview of Project

In this assignment, we are creating VBA script to analyze stock results for our friend Steve so he can help his parents choose the best green energy companies for investing. The analysis will consider:  

- **Daily Volume**: the total number of shares traded throughout the day to measure how actvively a stock is traded. 

- **Yearly Return**: the percentage difference (increase or decrease) in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

The end product needs to give Steve the tools he needs to easily run the program on his own with results that are quickly and easily understood. 

## Results
"Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
"The analysis is well described with screenshots and code. 

### Stock Performance
Twelve different stocks were analzed over two years. The results clearly show that 2017 was a good year for green energy but 2018 was not. Only two companies, ENPH and RUN had positive returns both years with ENPH far outperforming their competitors.

### Refactoring
'include screen shots of code!!!
Refactor (making code more efficient) to make the script run faster so Steve can perform the analsis on larger datasets in the future. 



#### Improved Run Times
Before Refactoring:


After Refactoring:

## Summary
"What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
"How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
"there must be a deteailed statementent of the advantages and disadvantages or refactoring code in general
"There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

Could use different shades of green to better differentiate the levels or degrees of positve performance.
